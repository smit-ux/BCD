In developing and developed nations, the risk of getting breast cancer is among the highest for women. An early diagnosis of breast cancer allows patients to be treated before metastasis (i. to I diagnoses and classifies), detects and classifies

The models we use depend on the deep learning framework for detecting and classification breast cancer in breast X-Ray images using CNN algorithm. The proposed model    can detect a mass region and classify it as malignant or benign on X-Ray images in one go with high accuracy.\

CNN was used to classify breast cancer into benign and malignant. To detect masses, feature fusion was applied using CNN deep features. Extreme learning machine (ELM) clustering was then applied to classify masses into benign and malignant.

I got 0.98 accuracy of the model.
